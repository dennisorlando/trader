Fork of dennisorlando/trader. I customize it a bit for my trader strategy

# Strategy 
Steps of the strategy:
1. Do buy lock on the BFB market, so it increases the price
2. Buy as much as possible from BOSE, because its prices change by insignificative value
3. Sell bought Good to BFB at increased price
4. Wait while the initial lock expires

At the end I sell the remaining Good to BOSE and DOGE
